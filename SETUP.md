Aircall App Setup Instructions
===

To install the Aircall app, you'll need an API key. Follow these steps to setup the app.

First, navigate to the [API Keys page](https://dashboard.aircall.io/view-api-keys) in your Aircall dashboard. Locate and click the `Generate an API key` button to create a new key.

In the modal window that appears, enter a descriptive name for your API key (e.g., "Deskpro App"). Be sure to securely store the API Token, as it will only be displayed once. Click Confirm when ready, then copy the provided API ID and API Token into the corresponding fields in the app's settings drawer in Deskpro.
